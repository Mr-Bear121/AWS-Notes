cloud computing - giving resources on demand using the internet
aws is infrastructure as a service (iaas) it also provide tools for work flow management. modile and other
scalability- how easy it is to scale up to bigger projects
elasticity - how quickly you can can scale up or down
agility - how quickly the service runs

aws resources -aws management consol - (GUI)
command line interface: (CLI)
Software Developement kits -(SDKs) - incorporate the connectivity and functionality of a wide range of cloud sevices into your code

ec2 - elastic compute cloud - the main tool used for aws

ebs - harddrive space as a service

s3 - data storage server
edge locations - areas where end user can access aws services- mostly found in major cities
availabitlity zone - isolated locations which public cloud services originate and operate

amazon virtual private network (VPC)

security responsibility model:physical,network,hypervisor,guestOS,Application,UserData

aws is resposible for everything below the guestOS

aws authentication:
temp is given to roles and perminent is given to users

------------create virtual private networks in the aws cloud

allows for control of the network configuration

offers several security controls.

also has inbuild security

scalable into other aws services-----------

Load balencer "elastic load balencing":

allows routing and routing rules to route data from an aplication into the system in the back

supports autoscaling

route 53 : dns service

also can route to the closest dns server in order to decrease latency

compliant with ipv 4 and 6

Challenges of running your own relational database:

server maintenance and engery consumption

software installation and patches

data base backups and availability

limits on scalability

data security

os installation and patches

Amazon RDS (Relational database systems):

manages:

everything above but it also
Scalable
manages power and rack & stack

AWS Lamba:severless compute program

supports multiple languages

event driven

pay per use computing

extract transorm and load

used for back-end development

Elastic BeanStalk: platform as a service

allows you to choose an instance of a database for your application

adjusts the autoscaling

allows you to update your app 

allows https for your application

provides:application service, http service operating system, language interpreter and host

auto updates your code when you change your application

amazon sns "simple notification service":

allows for mobile messaging and coordination of messaging

can be used to notify users of changes to your system

amazon cloud watch: event listener that can call porgrams to react to seen events on the cloud---------

collect metrics"data"

collect logs

set alarms 

make automatic changes to the cloud

amazon cloudfront:

aws global infrustructure

content delivery network "CDN"

can run a webserver to host your content

can "cache" your server so that if it crashes it still serves your content

some uses are: asset caching, video streaming, security and DDoS protection, API acceleration and software distribution

cloud formation:

simplifies tasks by grouping resources that power your apps "automates resource provisioning"

uses aws "management, CLI,SDK/API"

Fully-manages services
creates,updates and deletes resources in stacks

stack : unit of deployment "a grouping of resources"

can create templates visually to contruct code

AWS well-archected Framwork:

helps to understand and improve architecture

a list of question from different perspectives to increase best practices

5 different pillars : securit, reliability, performance and efficiency, cost optimization, operational excellence

AWS (IAM) identify and access managment

amazon inspector:----------------

delivered as a service

is used to check for security vulnerabilities with a checked system

AWS Shield "Ddos protection":

"Distributive denial of service"

Ddos attack is an attack that tries to flood your network or api to stop your servers

attacks the application layer

protects from query floods and http floods

security compliance:

aws responsability: prived the secure platform and features

Customer Responsibility: configure IT

amazon ebs:

used block storage

columes persist independently from the instance

analogus to a virtual disk

3 types of volumes

general purpose (SSD)

provisioned IOPS (SSD)

Magnetic
